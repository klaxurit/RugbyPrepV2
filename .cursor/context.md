# RugbyPrep V2 — Context

## Promise (MVP)
Generate rugby-oriented gym sessions that are coherent, safe, and coach-readable.

## Core concepts
- Block: a structured mini-unit with a single intent (activation/neural/contrast/force/core/neck/carry).
- Session: ordered blocks (Bloc A, B, C…).
- Mesocycle: 4 weeks (W1–W4). Intensity progresses mainly via RER.

## Intents
- activation: prepare joints/tissues (shoulders/hips).
- neural: low fatigue, high quality (jumps/throws/plyo/olympic variants).
- contrast: force + explosive + stability (rugby transfer).
- force: strength work without complex contrasts.
- finisher: ONE among neck/core/carry.

## MVP constraints
- Deterministic engine (same input -> same output).
- No long-term planning beyond W1–W4 versions.
- No AI program creation. AI may later explain/coach, not generate.
