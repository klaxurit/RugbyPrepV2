# Avatar System – Visual Progression Only

The avatar system exists to provide clear visual feedback and identity without affecting training decisions.

## Purpose
- Visual feedback for progression over time.
- Athlete identity and ownership of the journey.
- Motivation through visible evolution, not pressure.

## Non-negotiable rule
- Avatar has no impact on training outputs.
- Avatar is cosmetic only.

## Visual model
- 2D SVG avatar approach for clarity and lightweight rendering.
- Progression unlocked by level thresholds.
- Visual changes reflect the four stats:
  - FORCE: stronger frame presence (e.g., torso/upper-body mass cues).
  - PUISSANCE: more dynamic posture and athletic stance.
  - ARMURE: contact-ready visual cues (e.g., protective look).
  - ENDURANCE: cleaner, stable posture and sustained form cues.

## Cosmetics
- Jersey color options.
- Scrum cap variants.
- Armbands and small accessories.

## Experience principles
- Keep visuals readable and minimal.
- Preserve accessibility (clear contrast, understandable silhouettes).
- Avoid visual clutter and avoid systems that distract from training quality.
