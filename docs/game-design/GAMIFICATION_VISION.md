# RugbyPrep – Gamification Vision (RPG Lite)

Gamification in RugbyPrep exists to support training quality over time, not to turn training into a game for its own sake.

## Why it exists
- Build motivation between sessions, especially during hard weeks.
- Reinforce consistency: showing up regularly matters more than one big session.
- Encourage self-challenge: compare today to your own baseline, not to others.
- Support long-term engagement through clear progression signals.

## Core philosophy
- Performance > ego.
- Intelligence > grind.
- Recovery and deload are part of progression and must be rewarded.
- Rugby reality first: match load, collisions, fatigue, and readiness all matter.

## What RugbyPrep refuses
- No pain-based rewards.
- No overtraining incentives.
- No systems that push “always more” without context.
- No infantilization of athletes.

## Product intent
- Keep progression visible, simple, and useful for decision-making.
- Help athletes stay committed while respecting health and performance windows.
- Preserve coach logic: train hard when ready, reduce load when needed, progress over seasons.
