# Rugby RPG Lite – Progression System (V1.1 – Draft)

This document defines a future progression layer for RugbyPrep.  
Status: future feature, not implemented yet.

## Core stats
- FORCE: strength expression on main strength and contrast work.
- PUISSANCE: explosive output, neural quality, speed intent.
- ARMURE: robustness, neck/core/stability habits, contact readiness.
- ENDURANCE: repeatability, session completion capacity, work tolerance.

## How stats are earned
- Stats are awarded from completed blocks using block intent mapping.
- Users do not need to manually assign points.
- The system should stay transparent: each completed block contributes to one or more stats.

## XP system (simple)
- Base XP for a completed session.
- Extra XP when training logs are filled.
- Consistency bonus for regular completion over time.
- No bonus for reckless volume spikes.

## PR as progression signal
- PR (Personal Record) indicates personal improvement, not leaderboard competition.
- PR should reinforce technical quality and measurable progress.
- PR feedback must stay contextual and non-punitive.

## Deload and fatigue management rewards
- Deload is a positive progression behavior, not a penalty.
- Smart fatigue management (switching to deload when needed) should grant progression credit.
- Quality decisions under fatigue should be valued as highly as hard sessions.

## Design principles for implementation
- Keep rules simple and explainable to amateur rugby players.
- Prioritize deterministic behavior and clear feedback.
- Avoid hidden formulas and avoid gamification that conflicts with safe training.
